## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
list.files('~'). # read all the files in home directory
list.files('Desktop')  #list all files in desktop
#list.files('Desktop/Biol 668')
d1=read.table('RTestData.txt', header=TRUE)  # read the table and tell R that my first row is the header not the data
d1 # show the table
fuso.  # not working
d1$fuso # read column fuso in the table
attach(d1)
fuso # now it's working
```
```{r}
hist (d1$strep)
qqnorm(d1$strep) # no it's not linear
lstrep=log(d1$strep)
hist(lstrep)
```
```{r}
qqnorm(lstrep)# looks more linear
hist(lstrep) 
t.test(d1$strep,d1$fuso) # p-value = 0.001117

t.test(lstrep,d1$fuso) # p-value = 8.04e-16
# yes they are different
```
```{r}
d2= read.csv('primer.csv')
attach(d2) 
data.frame(d2)
```
```{r}
newdata=d1[order(time),]
time1=subset(d1, time =='1')
```
```{r}
write.csv(time1,"time1.csv")
r_bash.sh
r.py
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
